# Optimised KISS-ICP Configuration for Jetson Orin Nano (VLP-16)
# Goal: Reduce CPU usage by limiting range and increasing voxel size

kiss_icp_node:
  ros__parameters:
    # ROS-related optional parameters
    # These are already set in launch file, but good to have here too if needed
    # base_frame: "base_link"
    # lidar_odom_frame: "odom" 
    
    # Core KISS-ICP parameters
    data:
      deskew: False          # VLP-16 usually doesn't need heavy deskewing if spinning fast enough compared to motion
      max_range: 50.0        # Reduced from 100.0 to 50.0 to save CPU
      min_range: 1.0         # Ignored < 1.0m to remove self-reflections/noise

    mapping:
      voxel_size: 0.5        # Increased to 0.5 (default is usually smaller or adaptive) for faster processing
      max_points_per_voxel: 20
